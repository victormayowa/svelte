Scene 1: A Desperate Plea

(Tunde kneels on a threadbare rug, his voice heavy with despair.)

Tunde: (Muttering) Lord, I don't understand. I went to school, I did everything right, but here I am, begging for scraps. Every job feels like an insult to my degree.

(A loud banging interrupts his prayer. Mr. Johnson bursts in, his face contorted in anger.)

Mr. Johnson: Rent is due, Tunde! You think I can run this building on empty promises? When are you going to pay what you owe?

Tunde: (Startled) Mr. Johnson, I—

Mr. Johnson: (Interrupting) Don't give me excuses! You useless young people think the world owes you a living. Get a job, any job, and pay your rent!

(Mr. Johnson storms out, slamming the door behind him. Femi enters, his brow furrowed.)

Femi: What was that about? Did Mr. Johnson come for rent again?

Tunde: (Dejected) The same old story. He doesn't understand how hard it is out there.

Femi: I know, man. It's tough for everyone. But hey, chin up. Did you forget Mama Shade was looking for you? She said you still owe her for last week's groceries.

Tunde: (Groaning) Fantastic. Just what I need. More debt.

(Tunde and Femi leave the apartment, the weight of their circumstances heavy on their shoulders.)

Scene 2: Bargaining with Bitterness

(Tunde and Femi approach Mama Shade's stall, lined with colorful vegetables and vibrant spices.)

Femi: Mama Shade, good morning. We're so sorry, but Tunde won't be able to pay you today. He promises he'll settle the debt by the end of the week.

Mama Shade: (Her voice laced with frustration) Promises, promises! You young men are all the same. Every week it's the same story. When will I learn?

Tunde: (Trying to apologize) I understand your frustration, Mama Shade. It's not easy for me either. I'm looking for a decent job, but—

Mama Shade: (Interrupting) Excuses! I have bills to pay too! You think I can run my business on empty words? Come back when you have the money, young man!

(Tunde's phone buzzes. He sees a call from Pastor Akinyemi.)

Tunde: (Muttering) Excuse me, Femi. It's my pastor.

(Tunde answers the call, his voice filled with a flicker of hope.)

Scene 3: Finding Solace in Faith

(Tunde sits across from Pastor Akinyemi, tears welling up in his eyes.)

Tunde: Pastor, I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I'm drowning in debt, and there's no way out.

Pastor Akinyemi: (Placing a hand on Tunde's shoulder) My son, have faith. Remember, work is not a punishment, it's a sign of obedience to God. By working hard, you honor Him and provide for yourself.

Tunde: But what if I'm working hard and still not getting anywhere?

Pastor Akinyemi: Patience, Tunde. The Bible says, "Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen." (Hebrews 11:1) Trust in God's plan, and confess positive affirmations. Speak into existence the life you desire, the wealth you deserve. Remember, you are living beyond the limitations of this earthly economy; you are a citizen of the Kingdom of Heaven.
